## Introduction to the App... {data-background=#D3D3D3 .smaller}

<b>Ever wondered which advertising channel can help achieve more sales.... the following app could help!</b> 

### The Project
- The developing data products application uses Shiny to create an application which helps to solve this question
- There is an interavtive application hosted on ShinyApps.io and the Github page which contains all the underlying code

### The App 
- The applcation focusses on analysing company sales revenue given the spend on difference marketing channels; specifically on newspaper advertising, youtube or facebook
- The app allows the user to select the advertising type in order to display a plot of sales versus advertising spend including a regression line
- A slider allows the user to enter an advertising spend for a given channel and returns the predicted sales revenue it would generate



## Visualising the Data... {data-background=#D3D3D3 .smaller} 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
library(datarium) 
library(ggplot2)
data("marketing", package = "datarium")
plot(marketing, main = "Summary Scatterplots of Sales Revenue and Advertising Spend by Channel")
```

## The Server Calculation... {data-background=#D3D3D3}
- Below is the Server Calculation within the App, users can change the dropdown to visualise the sales revenue and predict sales for a given advertising spend

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
   knitr::include_graphics('./ServerCalculation.png')
```
